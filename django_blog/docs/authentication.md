Django Blog: Simple Authentication Guide
Overview
This documentation explains how to implement user authentication in a Django blog, covering registration, login, logout, and profile management.

Key Features
User Registration – Sign up with a username, email, and password.

Login & Logout – Secure access control using Django’s built-in authentication.

Profile Management – Users can view and update their details.

How It Works
Registration – Uses a custom form based on Django’s UserCreationForm with an added email field.

Login/Logout – Leverages Django’s default authentication views.

Security – Includes CSRF protection and password hashing for safety.

Implementation Steps
1. Views
Built-in Views – Use Django’s LoginView and LogoutView.

Custom Views – Create views for registration and profile updates.

2. Forms
Registration Form – Extend UserCreationForm to include an email field.

Profile Form – Optional form for additional user details.

3. URLs
Configure these routes in urls.py:

/login/ – User login

/logout/ – User logout

/register/ – New user signup

/profile/ – Profile management

4. Templates
Create these HTML files with forms and error messages:

login.html

register.html

logout.html (optional confirmation page)

profile.html

5. Testing
Register a new account.

Log in and verify restricted access.

Update profile information.

Log out and confirm session termination.

Important Notes
Security – Always include {% csrf_token %} in forms.

Redirects – Set LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL and LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL in settings.py.

Extended Profiles – For extra fields (e.g., profile pictures), link a Profile model to the User model.
